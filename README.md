# PROJECT TITLE 


## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
100 words to explain what your project is about to a general audience.

Industry Problem Statement : Effectively predicting and reducing legal and regulatory, operational and brand risk by accurately analysing management capabilities and maturity levels in Governance, Risk Management, Compliance, Architecture, Information Security and Audit.
Output : Maturity risk score i.e., analogous to a credit risk score

The industry problem would be based on machine learning and artificial intelligence work in understanding credit risk assessment.
The data available for the industry problem may be limited, with limited or no capability and maturity scores for different organisations within the group.
The project will therefore look at existing data and models for assessing credit risk in rural India where previous risk scores and credit ratings for loanees may not exist.

## DATA
